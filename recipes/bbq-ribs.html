        <ul>
            <li>1 slab ribs</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of Meathead's Memphis Dust</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons of Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    </div>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep.</strong> Rinse the ribs in cool water to remove any bone bits from the butchering.</li>

            <li>Trim the excess fat from both sides of the rack of ribs.</li>

            <li>Next it is time to add the salt. You can simply eyeball it by sprinkling on the same amount of salt you would sprinkle on the ribs if they were served to you unsalted. <em>If you can, give the salt 1 to 2 hours to be absorbed. The process of salting in advance is called dry brining.</em></li>

            <li><strong>Applying the rub</strong> Before applying the rub, just coat the meat with a thin layer of water.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Fire up.</strong> Pre-heat your barbecue smoker. Bring the temperature to about 225Â°F and try to keep it there throughout the cook.</li>

            <li><strong>Cook.</strong> Put the slabs in the cooker in indirect heat, meaty side up, close the lid, go read a book.</li>

            <li>For cooking time, allow 5 to 7 hours for St. Louis Cut (SLC) Ribs or Spare Ribs, and 3 to 5 hours for Baby Back Ribs.</li>

            <li>Once the ribs are done cooking it is time to add the sauce. Simply paint both sides of the rack with <em>Sweet Baby Ray's</em></li>
            <li><strong>Serve.</strong>Serve to your guests, and take a bow when the applause swells from the audience.</li>
        </ol>
